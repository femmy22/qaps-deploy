# Prewriting Evaluation Front-End

<br/>

## This section of the project is responsible for what will be shown for clinicians' tablets.

- This includes taking new prewriting evaluations and sending the drawing data to a back-end, as well as receiving and viewing previous evaluation data.
- The front-end will serve as the primary source of input and output.
- Logic for evaluation is handled in the back-end; no scoring is completed in this section.

<br/>

## Quick Note on Setup:

In the front-end directory, type `npm install` in the CLI. Any other setup information can be found [here](./ReactBasics.md).
